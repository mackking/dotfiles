dotfiles
========

My collection of system [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/). Rather than forking from one of the masters ([@matiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/), [@cowboy](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles), [@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles), etc) I am just borrowing liberaly and remixing into my own setup as my needs are much simpler than theirs (for now at least...).
